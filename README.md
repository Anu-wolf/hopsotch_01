Enhancing Computational Thinking through Interactive Hopscotch Game
-
In the modern educational landscape, fostering computational thinking skills among young learners is paramount for their success in an increasingly digital world. This project aims to achieve this goal by transforming the traditional hopscotch game into an interactive digital platform that engages students in computational thinking concepts.

Our Main Approach:
-

  -To develop an educational game that enhances computational thinking skills in young learners.
  -Utilize the familiar framework of hopscotch to create an engaging andinteractive learning experience.
  -Incorporate key computational thinking principles, including decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms.
  -Provide varying levels of difficulty to accommodate learners of different skill levels.
  -The interactive hopscotch game consists of three main levels, each designed to target specific computational thinking skills while maintaining the essence of the     
   traditional game.

What we've done so far:
-
  *The game consist of 9 levels that you can poke around and play to improve your computational thinking skills.
  *Levels 1-4 challenges you to arrange hopscotch tiles with varying constraints as the level progresses. The purpose of these few levels is to enhance spatial reasoning,    
   pattern analysis and sequencing skills
  *Level 5 makes you match the number on tiles with the correct round depicted on the screen. This aims to improve your understanding of visual cues abstraction skills 
    through repeated exposure.
  *Objective of Level 6 is to deduce the next round number based on the revealed random number. It enhances numerical fluency and logical deduction skills.
  *The Level 7 introduces to the heart of the game where you get to play the actual hopscotch game by arranging sequential button presses to navigate the digital hopscotch 
   grid.This reinforces of sequential logic and computational problem-solving.
  *The next few levels introduces the concept of variables & conditional if-else loops in the form of symbols and questions through choosing the correct options among many 
   provided in a tabular format.
